## Requirements
- Java 21 or later
- JavaFX 21

It's quite complicated to setup JavaFX if you use VSCode. I suggest you to install IntelliJIDEA and JavaFX. Put JavaFX jar to module in java. If there's any problem to setup this, you can go to CLI branch to run CLI version.


But if you use IntellliJ, you can follow this:

```python
cd src/gui
```
And then run MainGUI.App
